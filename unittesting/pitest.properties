# PiTest Configuration Properties
# This file contains configuration for PiTest mutation testing

# Target classes to mutate (source code)
targetClasses=MyClass,math.*,io.*

# Target test classes that will be used to kill mutations
targetTests=*Test

# Classes to exclude from mutation (test classes and inner test classes)
excludedClasses=*Test,*Test$*

# Output formats (HTML and XML)
outputFormats=HTML,XML

# Mutators to use (DEFAULTS includes the most common mutators)
mutators=DEFAULTS

# Number of threads to use (adjust based on your system)
threads=4

# Timeout settings
timeoutFactor=2.0
timeoutConstant=10000

# Verbose output for debugging
verbose=true

# Generate timestamped reports (set to false for consistent paths)
timestampedReports=false

# Coverage threshold (percentage of lines that must be covered)
# Set to 0 to allow mutation testing even with low coverage
coverageThreshold=0

# Mutation threshold (percentage of mutations that must be killed)
# Set to 0 to allow any mutation score
mutationThreshold=0

# Additional mutators that can be enabled:
# - STRONGER: More aggressive mutators
# - ALL: All available mutators
# - REMOVE_CONDITIONALS: Remove conditional statements
# - NEGATE_CONDITIONALS: Negate conditional statements
# - MATH: Mathematical operator mutations
# - INCREMENTS: Increment/decrement mutations
# - RETURN_VALS: Return value mutations
# - VOID_METHOD_CALLS: Remove void method calls
# - CONSTRUCTOR_CALLS: Constructor call mutations

# Example of using specific mutators:
# mutators=REMOVE_CONDITIONALS,NEGATE_CONDITIONALS,MATH,INCREMENTS,RETURN_VALS
